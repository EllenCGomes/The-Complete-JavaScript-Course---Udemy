/* Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76m tall. */

let marksWeight = 95;
const marksHeight = 1.88;

let johnsWeight = 85;
const johnsHeight = 1.76;

const marksBmi = marksWeight / marksHeight ** 2;
const johnsBmi = johnsWeight / johnsHeight ** 2;

console.log(marksBmi, johnsBmi);

/* Improve the code you already wrote.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" */

const johnsBmiNew = johnsWeightNew / johnsHeightNew ** 2;


if (marksBmiNew > johnsBmiNew) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI ${marksBmiNew} is higher than John's ${johnsBmiNew}`)
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI ${marksBmiNew} is higher than Mark's ${johnsBmiNew}`)
